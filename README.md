# Algorithm Visualizer 🧠✨

A beginner-friendly **Algorithm Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project visually demonstrates how sorting algorithms work step by step with animations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visual representation of array elements as boxes
- Step-by-step animation with controlled speed
- Color-coded comparisons and swaps
- Reset functionality
- Multiple sorting algorithms using the same visual system

---

## 📊 Implemented Algorithms

### 🔹 Bubble Sort
- Compares adjacent elements
- Swaps elements with smooth horizontal animation
- Highlights comparisons and swaps clearly

### 🔹 Selection Sort
- Highlights the current index and minimum element
- Uses arrows and lift animation to show swap intent
- Clean visualization without overlapping elements

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the application
- **CSS** – Styling, colors, animations
- **JavaScript** – Algorithm logic and DOM manipulation

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding sorting algorithms visually
- Clear separation of logic, animation, and UI
- DOM manipulation and CSS-based animations
- Debugging real-world frontend issues
- Writing clean, structured JavaScript code

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `day3.html` in your browser
3. Click on a sorting algorithm to start visualization
4. Use **Reset** to restart

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add more algorithms (Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)
- Pause / Resume controls
- Speed slider
- Deploy using GitHub Pages
